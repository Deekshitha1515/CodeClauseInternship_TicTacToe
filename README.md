## Description
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The game is also known as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os. Here's a description of Tic Tac Toe from a student's perspective:

Tic Tac Toe is a fun and simple game that can be played with a pen and paper or using a computer program. The game is played on a square grid, typically 3x3, although larger grids are possible. Two players take turns marking empty squares with their respective symbols, usually "X" and "O", with the goal of getting three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game starts with an empty grid. Player 1, often represented by "X", goes first and marks a square on the grid with their symbol. Then, Player 2, represented by "O", takes their turn and marks an empty square. Players continue taking turns until one player achieves three of their symbols in a row, or until all squares are filled, resulting in a draw.

Tic Tac Toe is a game of strategy and anticipation. Players must think ahead and try to block their opponent's moves while planning their own winning strategy. Despite its simplicity, Tic Tac Toe can be surprisingly challenging and engaging, making it a popular game for players of all ages.

Overall, Tic Tac Toe is a great game to play to pass the time, challenge friends, and sharpen your strategic thinking skills.
